      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>

        Modern robots, from assistive and social robots to self-driving cars, are increasingly operating in human-centered environments, 
        requiring them to collaborate more closely with human users than ever before. Beyond performing useful tasks, these robots must 
        also learn and adapt through human interactions to become more effective and intuitive partners. Designing robotic agents that 
        can work alongside, learn from, and adapt to humans is a key research challenge, requiring solutions that address diverse interaction 
        types—including demonstrations, corrections, natural language commands, and preference-based feedback. Another challenge lies in 
        how robots interpret and respond to human input, which can be ambiguous, noisy, and vary across users. Robots must be able to 
        adapt to different interaction styles and evolving user needs while maintaining robust and sample-efficient learning mechanisms. 
        Unlike traditional machine learning settings, where large-scale datasets can be collected and labeled offline, human-in-the-loop 
        learning often requires real-time adaptation with limited supervision, making efficient use of human guidance a critical challenge.

      <!-- <ul>
        <li> <b>High-level vs. Low-level Representations:</b> Is 3D vision crucial, or
          can 2D representations suffice for robotic tasks? How should robots inter-
          pret the world—through point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, or other output
          formats? What input modalities offer the most efficiency and generaliza-
          tion?
        </li>
        <li> <b>Pretraining for Policy Learning:</b> Do low-level policies require exten-
          sive pretraining, or could projections from vision-language models serve
          as adequate features? Is it possible that distilled 2D features are sufficient
          for policy learning, or is a deeper, 3D-centric approach needed? </li>
        <li> <b>3D Vision-Language Action Models:</b> What are the specific challenges
          in using 3D VLMs for robotic actions, particularly regarding sensor cali-
          bration and real-time performance? </li>
      </ul> -->

      <!-- We are bringing together a diverse group of leading experts in the field to present their latest research 
      findings and future perspectives, with an emphasis on scalable, generalizable, and adaptable 3D VLM frameworks for Robotics. 
      Our goal is for this workshop to inspire and drive future innovations in 3D foundation models specifically realting to the robotics manipulation domain. -->
      </p>
      <p>      
        Addressing these challenges demands interdisciplinary collaboration across fields such as machine learning, cognitive science, and 
        control theory. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and human-computer 
        interaction to explore various approaches to human-in-the-loop robot learning. As robots are increasingly deployed in real-world environments, 
        it is more crucial than ever for these agents to be able to correct mistakes on the fly and rapidly personalize their behavior to different 
        users and scenarios. Through discussions on methodologies, benchmarks, and real-world applications, we aim to identify open problems and 
        future directions in human-interactive robot learning.

                <div id="talk1" class="talk-abstract">
                  The talk will focus on how to incorporate human physical behaviour into the robot control loop for adaptive human-robot co-manipulation and co-learning.
                  The human physical behaviour is encoded with several approaches. Higher-level human physical behaviour is learned with a statistical machine learning
                  method to capture the stochasticity in human actions. The learned behaviour is also augmented by human motor control models that provide additional
                  intent prediction capabilities to the collaborating robot by understanding the underlying tradeoffs in human movements. The insights about the
                  lower-level human physical behaviour are incorporated via musculoskeletal models to ensure ergonomics and safety of co-manipulation. Finally,
                  a co-learning method based on reinforcement learning facilitates continuous adaptation of both the robot and the human. For a more direct 
                  transfer of human skill, we will examine the concept of teaching robots through teleimpedance, where the developed interfaces enable a 
                  human operator to (remotely) teach and correct physically interactive tasks.

                <div id="talk2" class="talk-abstract">
                  Assistive robots hold a promise of addressing critical societal needs with an aging
                  population, such as supporting older adults with activities of daily living. Yet, current systems are
                  costly, narrowly focused, and unscalable. While large-scale datasets and generalist policies
                  show promise, achieving positive societal impact will require robots to learn directly from
                  diverse, non-expert users, who often lack expertise as robot teachers to provide effective data.
                  In this talk, I will share findings from studies with individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment
                  (MCI) and their caregivers, offering unique insights into the challenges and design principles for
                  user-driven robot learning. I will also present approaches to help end-users provide better
                  demonstrations, including a reciprocal teaching framework where robots model user behaviors
                  and offer real-time feedback. Finally, I will propose a roadmap for removing roboticists from the
                  loop, enabling scalable, autonomous deployment of cognitive robots in homes.

                <div id="talk4" class="talk-abstract">
                  How can we build robots that meaningfully assist people with mobility limitations in their daily lives?
                  To support complex caregiving tasks such as robot-assisted feeding, transferring, bathing, and meal preparation,
                  robots must physically interact with people and objects in dynamic, unstructured environments where 
                  robot autonomy can fail. In this talk, I will present our work on building human-in-the-loop physical
                  robot caregiving systems that integrate multimodal perception with adaptive algorithms, enabling them
                  to be used by non-expert users and to adapt their strategies to unique user preferences. Together, 
                  these efforts move us closer to creating caregiving robots that are not only technically capable, but 
                  are also responsive to the real needs of people in care settings.

                <div id="talk6" class="talk-abstract">
                  We are interested in collaborative planning between agents that learns and humans in
                  environments that are dynamic and time-stressed. In such a setting, plan generation may
                  involve multiple iterations of human feedback to an AI in order to effectively capture the
                  human's preferences for various plan constraints, or when plans need to be revised . This
                  topic presents two major challenges relevant to this talk. First, Reinforcement Learning,
                  the natural framework for sequential decision making, produces black box policies,
                  making it very challenging (impossible) for humans to interact with it in bidirectional ways.
                  Second, Reinforcement Learning has shown to be vulnerable to mis-specification of the
                  reward function resulting in mis-alignment of the reward with human intended goal(s).
                  Finally, Reinforcement Learning policies determine actions to perform in a given
                  environment state during execution; extracting long-term plans from policies is difficult,
                  especially where environments are highly uncertain, or where a model of environment
                  dynamics is unavailable. To address these challenges we have developed a neuro-
                  symbolic approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to translate user
                  feedback to machine-understandable goal specifications for interpretable interaction
                  between human and agent. Creating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the
                  planning domain, problem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting
                  the utility of these tools for non-expert humans. Our approach performs initial translation
                  of goal specifications to a set of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) goal
                  constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in imprecise symbolic
                  specifications, which are difficult to validate directly. To address this, we use an
                  evolutionary approach to generate a population of symbolic goal specifications and train a
                  LSTM model to assess whether induced plans in the population adheres to the natural
                  language user goal specifications and feedback. I will present our approach, evaluation
                  results and discuss open challenges.
